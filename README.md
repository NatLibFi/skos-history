skos-history
============

"What's new?" and "What has changed?" are common user questions when a new version of a SKOS vocabulary is published.

This project tries to take advantage of the regular structure of SKOS files to make these questions answerable for both non-geeky humans and machines. To this end, an ontology/application profile and a set of processing practices are developed.

The use cases to be covered are discussed in [List of Use Cases](https://github.com/jneubert/skos-history/wiki/List-of-Use-Cases), the [List of Change Categories](https://github.com/jneubert/skos-history/wiki/List-of-Change-Categories) and in the [issue queue](https://github.com/jneubert/skos-history/issues?state=open).

One approach to provide the infrastructure to these ends is described here as [Versions and Deltas as Named Graphs](https://github.com/jneubert/skos-history/wiki/Versions-and-Deltas-as-Named-Graphs).
