STW Thesaurus for Economics
---------------------------

The proposed [Dataset versioning
ontology](http://purl.org/iso25964/DataSet/Versioning#)
([github](https://github.com/JohanDS/Dataset-versioning--for-KOS-data-sets-))
and skos-history approach is implemented in the HTML/RDFa pages of the STW.

The page for the version history set is at http://zbw.eu/stw/version. The
current STW version page (http://zbw.eu/stw/version/latest) links to that
version history set and to its particular version history record. Please use
the "RDF/XML" or "RDF/Turtle" links on the pages to look at the actual triples.

The files in this directory are an early experimental implementation, outdated now.
