STW Thesaurus for Economics
---------------------------

The proposed [Dataset versioning
ontology](http://purl.org/iso25964/DataSet/Versioning#)
([github](https://github.com/JohanDS/Dataset-versioning--for-KOS-data-sets-))
and skos-history approach is implemented in the HTML/RDFa pages of the STW.

The version history set is at http://zbw.eu/stw/version. The current STW
version (http://zbw.eu/stw/version/latest) links its version history record and
to that version history set.

The files in this directory are an early experimental implementation, outdated now.
